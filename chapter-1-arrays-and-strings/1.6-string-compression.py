""" 1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using hte counts of repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa' would become 'a2b1c5a3'. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
